    "    - Qualitative (categorical) or quantitative (numerical).\n",

    "    - Example: Temperature (e.g., 20째F-30째F has the same difference as 50째F-60째F).\n",
    "    - Likert scale data can be considered as interval measurements if the intervals are the same.\n",
    "    - Mathematical operations: sum, difference, mean, standard deviation, correlation.\n",
    "    - There is no meaningful zero.\n",

    "4. Ratio:\n",
    "    - Strongest level of measurement.\n",
    "    - There is a meaningful zero.\n",

    "    - Any mathematical operation (ratios, logarithms).\n",
