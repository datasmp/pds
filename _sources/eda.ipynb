    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) delves into the data's depths, revealing its underlying patterns and connections.\n",
    "- EDA is an initial exploration to grasp the data's nuances.\n",
    "- It helps us to understand the different facets of the dataset.\n",
    "- EDA helps to derive meaningful conclusions from the insights of the data.\n",

    "1. Import the data\n",
    "    - You can import data from a local computer, website, or using an API like yfinance.\n",
    "    - You can also use some built-in datasets.\n",
    "    - You can import Excel or CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explore the Data\n",
    "    - You can use the methods *head(), tail(), columns, index, info(), describe()*.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cleaning and refining the data:\n",
    "    - Check data types using info().\n",
    "        - If a numerical feature is given as a string, do conversion.\n",
    "        - If a date feature is given as a string, do conversion.\n",
    "    - You can change the column or row labels.\n",
    "        - You can use rename() to change column or row labels.\n",
    "        - You can use reset_index() or set_index() to change indexes or row labels.\n",
    "    - Rectifying missing values.\n",
    "        - You can use *info(), isnull() or notnull()* to detect missing values.\n",
    "        - You can either drop or fill the missing values.\n",
    "            - Drop rows or columns with missing values.\n",
    "        - Fill in the missing values.\n",
    "            - You can fill it with a constant value or the mean/median of the column.\n",
    "            - You can use imputation methods.\n",
    "    - Eliminating duplications.\n",
    "        - You can use *duplicate()* to determine repeated rows.\n",
    "        - You can either drop the repetitions or keep them.\n",
    "        - You can use *drop_duplicates()* to remove repetitions.\n",
    "    - Filtering out extraneous noise.\n",
    "    - Spotting and rectifying anomalies and outliers.\n",
    "        - You can either remove them or keep them.\n",
    "        - You can use different definitions of outliers.\n",
    "            - One method is using the interquartile range (IQR).\n",
    "    - Removing redundancies.\n",
    "        - Drop the columns which do not provide useful information.\n",
    "    - Scaling Data\n",
    "        - If the scales of featues are different, it might be a good idea to change their scale to the same level.\n",
    "        - You can use *StandardScaler()* or *MinMaxScaler()*.\n",

    "4. Statistical Tools\n",
    "    - Utilize statistical tools and graphs to derive insights from the data.\n",
    "    - Uncovering significant features and interrelations among them.\n",
    "    - You can find correlations between features using the method *corr()*.\n",
    "    - You can display it using *sns.heatmap()*.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Visualization\n",
    "    - Utilize graphs to derive insights from the data.\n",
    "    - You can use line plots, scatter plots, histograms, pie charts, pair plots.\n"
